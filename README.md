# This is repo to track my progress of testing QAT with IntelÂ® QuickAssist Adapter 8950

Product brief at the moment of writing this README is hosted there https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ethernet-products/gigabit-server-adapters/quickassist-adapter-8950-brief.html

Goals (I'm planning to make all testing on CentOS 7):

1) openssl QAT engine testing (using openssl benchmarks)
2) haproxy testing;
3) nginx testing; 
4) ipsec (with available implementations);
