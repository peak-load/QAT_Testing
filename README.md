# This is repo to track my progress of testing QAT with IntelÂ® QuickAssist Adapter 8950

Product brief at the moment of writing this README is hosted there https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ethernet-products/gigabit-server-adapters/quickassist-adapter-8950-brief.html

## Goals (I'm planning to make all testing on CentOS 7):

[ ] openssl QAT engine testing (using openssl benchmarks);

[x] haproxy testing;

### no QAT no SSL 

#### 10000 requests
